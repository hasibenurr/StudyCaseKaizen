Here my conditions:
* Code must be unique and 8 length
* Code only has "ACDEFGHKLMNPRTXYZ234579" characters

Acording to first condition, I defined CreateAESCode function and used AES encryption for security.

After that, beacuse of the second condition, I tried to arrange my encrypt key and defined ValidValues function.
In this way, my new key's lenght is 8 and only has requested chars.


Acording to my research, it does not seem possible to generate values ​​in certain numbers and characters with standard encrypt methods. 
For this reason, I intervened myself in the resulting data.

If there is an easier way, please let me know.
